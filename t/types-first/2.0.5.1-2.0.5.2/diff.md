 ## 2.0.5.1 (2023-02-21)
 
 Stubtest settings: change `ignore_missing_stub` default to `false` (#9779)
 
 If you're reading about this commit from an autogenerated changelog entry, this should have no user-visible impact on how the stubs are interpreted by a type checker; it's just an internal change to how typeshed's tests work.
